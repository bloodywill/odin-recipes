      <h4>Steps</h4>

            <li>
               <p>Chicken</p>
               <p>Put chicken legs in pot, cover with water. Bring the water to a boil.
Skim the shit off the top. When it boils, dump it and refill.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Mirepoix</p>
               <p>Cut the onions, celery, and carrots into large dice and peel the garlic.
Gather together  the parlsey, thyme, bay leaves, and peppercorns.               
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Broth</p>
               <p>Once the gross stuff has been skimmed, throw some salt, the
mirepoix, and your pile of herbs into the broth. Cook until Meat is cooked.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Meat and Bones</p>
               <p>Once the meat is cooked, pull the meat out. Once the meat isn't 
too hot to touch, debone the meat and take the good meat and set aside.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Broth (again)</p>
               <p>Once you pull the meat out, put the bones back in the broth. 
Simmer for an hour for extra bone flavour. Once an hour has passed, strain the broth
through some cheesecloth. Skim some fat off the top. Look at you. You made broth.
